# Book Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This Book Recommendation System suggests books to users based on **collaborative filtering** and **popularity-based filtering** techniques. The system utilizes user ratings, book popularity, and similarity measures to provide personalized recommendations.

## 🚀 Features
- 📚 **Popularity-Based Recommendations**: Suggests top trending books based on overall ratings and reviews.
- 🤝 **Collaborative Filtering**: Provides personalized recommendations by analyzing user preferences and similar readers.
- 📊 **Data Processing & Analysis**: Cleans and preprocesses book datasets for better recommendation accuracy.
- 🔍 **User-Based & Item-Based Recommendations**: Implements similarity-based approaches for better suggestions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Tools**:
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
 

## 📂 Dataset Used
The dataset consists of:
- **Books Data**: Contains book details (title, author, genre, etc.).
- **Users Data**: Information about registered users.
- **Ratings Data**: User ratings for books.

## 📜 How to Install & Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-rcmd.git
   cd book-rcmd
   ```
2. **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   (Modify `app.py` if using a web-based framework like Flask or Streamlit.)

## 📊 Recommendation Techniques
### 1️⃣ **Popularity-Based Filtering**
- Recommends books with the highest average ratings.
- Uses weighted rating formulas to prioritize books with sufficient user feedback.

### 2️⃣ **Collaborative Filtering**
- **User-Based Filtering**: Recommends books based on similar user preferences.
- **Item-Based Filtering**: Suggests books similar to the ones a user has liked.
- Uses `Surprise` library to implement models like **SVD, KNN, and ALS**.


Use of Similarity Score in a Book Recommendation System
In your Book Recommendation System using Collaborative and Popularity-Based Filtering, similarity scores are essential for making accurate recommendations.

1️⃣ Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)
User-Based Filtering: The similarity score helps find users with similar reading preferences.

Example: If User A and User B have rated similar books highly, the system can recommend books that User B liked to User A.

Common Similarity Measures:

Cosine Similarity

Pearson Correlation

Item-Based Filtering: The similarity score finds books similar to those a user has already liked.

Example: If a user liked Book X, the system finds books similar to Book X based on past user ratings.

2️⃣ Popularity-Based Filtering (Sorting by Weighted Ratings)
Similarity scores aren’t used directly in this method.

Books are ranked based on average ratings and the number of ratings.

3️⃣ Hybrid Filtering (Combining Both Methods)
The similarity score helps merge popularity and collaborative filtering to give better recommendations.

Example: A book with high ratings and similar content to a user’s past preferences is recommended.




## 📌 Future Enhancements
- 🔥 **Hybrid Filtering**: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Develop a frontend using Flask .
